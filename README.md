Stage 0 is an early stage where we implemented 'ask' in data life cycle. There are details about our role, problem statement, goal, objective and business metrics of our project.


## Stage 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis

Stage 1 is a next step that we focused on gathering insights from statistical views.

What we have done on this stage:

Descriptive Analysis,
Univariate Analysis,
Multivariate Analysis,
Business Insight As Business Recommendation

On stage 1, we do data exploration and visualization known as Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insight of the dataset. 
These are some business insight we got through the EDA process:

1. The marketing team can create campaign that focuses on customer that frequently flyer, ever travelled abroad, have high income, and work in private sectors, so it's easier to attract their interest which lead to consideration in buying travel indsurance
2. The marketing team can also reduce or stop campaign for those from outside the 4 categories in order to decrease the campaign cost or allocated to campaign for the prospective customer
3. The campaign can be an awareness to customers or prospective customers who included on the 4 categories, to expected later they understand the purpose of travel insurance provided by UNO Inc.
